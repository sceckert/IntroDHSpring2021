### REQUIRED TEXTS ## 

Almost all the readings will be available online through either our course website or Canvas, with the possible exception of Ted Underwood’s *Distant Horizons: Digital Evidence and Literary Change* (University of Chicago, 2019). The book should be available at Labyrinth Books [https://www.labyrinthbooks.com/product/9780226612836](https://www.labyrinthbooks.com/product/9780226612836) or on Powells, Amazon, etc. If you experience any difficulty in obtaining a copy of this text, or if purchasing the book poses any financial burden, please let me know and we can make arrangements.

### ATTENDANCE & PARTICIPATION

As this is a discussion-based seminar, active participation is essential.  Part of your responsibility to the seminar is to arrive on time, to complete the reading and exercise, and to be prepared to engage in class discussions and activities. I understand that life happens, especially in the middle of a global pandemic. If you must miss class, please try to let me know in advance. You're allowed to miss up to three classes––no questions asked. Any more absences may affect your grade, with the exception, of course, of medical or personal emergencies (e.g you or a loved one getting COVID-19). 

Since this an exceptional academic year, if you find yourself struggling, please get in touch with me as soon as possible and we will try to work out accommodations.


### (REMOTE) CLASSROOM CULTURE

**Zoom Etiquette**: So that we can better facilitate class discussions and thinking together, I'll ask that we try to follow a few guidelines:

- Please use your camera if your internet connection allows it
- Please use headphones on our Zoom call if possible to reduce background noise
- Try not not to speak over one another (but if it does happen, be polite)
- Use the chat and hand-raising tools on Zoom to indicate that you'd like to speak, if there's an active conversation
- Respond to and acknowledge your peers’ contributions
- *Take space / make space*
	- if you feel you contributed a lot, take a step back and make space for others 
	- if you have not contributed yet, try and get more engaged.

***Etiquette (Classroom & Email):*** Refer to your classmates by name. Try not to make assumptions about gender pronouns. Whenever you email me or a classmate, keep it cordial. Include a greeting and your name at the end.

**Distractions & Remote-Learning:** Because we will be on our screens in this course, it's important to create an atmosphere that minimizes distraction. During our class sessions––whether we're in discussion or in group or solo work––please close all browser windows except those with our course materials. Please, no scrolling through Instagram, checking your email, or texting.

### LATE WORK
You may have up to 3 extensions, provided that you request them in advance. For weekly homework, since the assignments build upon one another, you may have up to 48 hrs to turn them in. Assignments turned in outside these parameters will be penalized by 10% each day it is late.


### STUDENT RESOURCES: 

#### ***Accommodations for Students with Disabilities***:

I want to make sure that everyone in this class has the access to the materials, resources, and support they need to learn most effectively. You are always free to talk to me about your situation.

## ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

You are required to adhere to the Princeton University Honor Code [https://ua.princeton.edu/contents/undergraduate-honor-system](https://ua.princeton.edu/contents/undergraduate-honor-system). In short: don’t cheat. 

In this course we will be engaging in many different forms of work, including individual writing and coding as well as collaborative work with your classmates. In all of these cases, it is vital to give credit to others for their work. If you're ever in doubt about whether or not you need to cite or give credit––whether that source is a course project or a classmate or course discussion––always err on the side of citation! We will talk about how best to cite and give appropriate credit for different kinds of intellectual labor over the course of the semester.  If you need help, see the instructor.
