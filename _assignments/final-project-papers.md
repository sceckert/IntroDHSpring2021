# Final Project Reflection Paper

## What you will turn in:

For your final project reflection paper, you'll 4-5 page an individual paper. In this paper, you'll discuss:

-  the finalized state of your project (including relevant visualizations or websites produced)
- your final findings  (incorporate feedback from today's presentation)
- Your assessment of the project (think of this a little as a DH review of your own project)
- An argument about what you found. 
	- This can be about the data of your project. Or it can take the form of an argument about the methods you used
- Any final reflections on the next stages of the process.
