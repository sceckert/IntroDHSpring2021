# Homework 2

This week's homework has two goals: getting us all set up to start writing code in Python and doing some preliminary work using Jupyter 

## PART 1:  Installing Anaconda

In this course, we're going to be working primarily with Python.[^1] There are a number of ways to install Python. We're going to install the latest version of Python 3 using Anaconda. Anaconda a Python distribution with other really useful data science packages as well as the open-source web application, Jupyter Notebooks. We'll be using in this course.


### Step 1


1. Go to [the Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Scroll down to the bottom of the page to find the downloader for your operating system. Find your operating system, and click on the link to download the installer. Unless you're already very comfortable using the command line, you should choose the "Graphical Installer" version, which will allow you to navigate Anaconda through an app-like interface called **Anaconda Navigator**.  

2. Once you click on the link, follow the instructions to open the installer, and follow the installer directions. 
	- For Mac OS: Select "Install for me only" when prompted to select a destination
	- For Windows: Select "Just Me," then select a destination folder to install Anaconda (this folder name should not contain any spaces)
	- For Linux, you will not have the option to install the Graphical installer. Instead, follow the instructions for your Linux distribution here: [https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/)

3. Anaconda will ask whether you want to add Anaconda to your PATH environmental variable. By adding Anaconda to your PATH, you will be able to launch Jupyter notebooks from the command line as well as from the Anaconda Navigator interface.

3. Once you have downloaded, verify your installation: [https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/verify-install/](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/verify-install/)


#### Step 2 ####

Launch Anaconda Navigator as you would any app.

- For Mac OS, navigate to your "Applications" folder, then click on the Anaconda Navigator icon (or search "Anaconda Navigator" in Finder)

- For Windows: Navigate to the Windows start menu. "Start" > "Anaconda4 (64-bit)"  >  "Anaconda Navigator""


- Note: for Linux / UNIX: 

## Installing a Text Editor ###

We are going to be BBEDit and Atom are both good open-source text editors. Choose one: 

- To download BBEDit, go to the download page: [https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/]index.html and select the free version
- To download Attom, visit the download page, and then follow [the download instructions](https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/) for your operating system.


[^1]: Why Python? One reason is that it's flexible and popular within digital humanities research. Take a look at ["Which DH Tools Are Actually Used in Research?"](https://weltliteratur.net/dh-tools-used-in-research/) (Dec. 6, 2019), a study by Laure Barbot, Frank Fischer, Yoann Moranville and Ivan Pozdniakov, which looks at tools mentioned in the DH conferences, ADHO between 2015-2019
