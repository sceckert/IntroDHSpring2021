## Sentences in Conrad and Norris

We've read Edith Rickert's method for comparing and visualizing style in works of literature––what she calls "graphical and statistical methods"––using two short passages from Joseph Conrad and Frank Norris as examples. 

> The sky was a miracle of purity, a miracle of azure. The sea was polished, was blue, was pellucid, was sparkling like a precious stone, extending on all sides, all round to the horizon—as if the whole terrestrial globe had been one jewel, one colossal sapphire, a single gem fashioned into a planet.
> ––Joseph Conrad, *Youth* (1910)



> Every day and all day the same pale-blue sky and the un-
winking sun over the moving speck. Every day and all day the same black-blue water world untouched by any known wind, smooth as a slab of syenite, colourful as an opal, stretched out and around and beyond and before and behind us, forever, illimitable, empty.
>–––Frank Norris, “The Ship That Saw a Ghost,” A Deal in Wheat (1903)

1. With your partner, come up with a list of other ways that we might compare the two passages through counting or visualization. 
	- (You might look at particular aspects of their form, imagery, sentence/word lengths, word choices, rhythm, or connective phrases).

2. What things can we explore with Rickert's method that would be difficult to explore using a tool like GoogleNgrams or ECCO?

3. What kind of questions can we ask with Google-Ngrams (or ECCO) that we can't ask with Rickert's method? 


### Comparing and Counting: US Inaugural Addresses

For the rest of today's exercise, we're going to explore Rickert's methods for counting by hand by testing them out in another realm: the style of political addresses.

[The U.S. Inaugural Addresses zip file (.zip)](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/_downloads/b0f5605a8148b7b96b46cb1946f6d34e/US_Inaugural_Addresses.zip) contains a collection of text files (.txt) of U.S. Inaugural Addresses ranging from President George Washington (1789) to President Donald Trump (2017). Each text file is titled with a number, the corresponding last name of the U.S. President, and the corresponding year of the Inaugural Address. The dataset was assembled by David Mimno and Melanie Walsh from US government records.

1. Download the [zip file](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/_downloads/b0f5605a8148b7b96b46cb1946f6d34e/US_Inaugural_Addresses.zip) and then unzip the file.
2. With your partner, choose two addresses. (Try to be creative, so that we aren't all looking at the same set of speeches)
3. Using Rickert's method of counting, compare the **first two sentences of each address**, counting and diagramming only by hand. 
	- You might:
		- count syllables
		- count the number of each noun
		- count the length of each clause
		- count imagery patterns
	- and you might
		- diagram or draw any of these patterns
		- experiment with other ways to visualize these patterns
3. What do you notice?
	- What can we learn about the openings of speeches? Which of your assumptions about the rhetoric of inaugural addresses did it reinforce? Which assumptions did it denaturalize?

4. Imagine a friend in another class, whose never read Rickert, but who is interested in what counting could tell us about all 58 inaugural addresses. **Write out, step by step, what your friend would have to do to precisely replicate your analysis.**
	- Think about the methods that you used while counting, comparing, or drawing. 
		- What methods would be possible to convey to the friend?
		- What parts of your analysis would be difficult to turn into repeatable instructions?
	- Now, think about how you could make that set of instructions readable to a machine. What would you have to define?
	
Pssst....congratulations! You just created a very informal type of algorithm.
