## Notes from seminar:

Two approaches: 
- One, a historical question about a word we might associate with 21st century computation (a history of "data"), 
- the other, a "scientific" approach to literary study from the early 20th century.



Rosenberg's "Data before the Fact," in *'Raw Data' is an Oxymoron*, ed. by Virginia Jackson and Lisa Gitelman (2013)

"Data is rhetorical" (Rosenberg 18)

Data is not necessarily true: A datum may also be a fact, just as a fact may be evidence. But, from its first vernacular formulation, the existence of a datum has been independent of any consideration of corresponding ontological truth. When a fact is proven false, it ceasesto be a fact. False data is data nonetheless."  (18)


Forms of data:

- Fitbit trackerts
- Sleep apps
- Wourdcounts of a papwer
- Two tweets: "data is everything" and "the data does not speak for itself"
- data ss that which is easily countable or quantifiable?


## Questions:

Where did these books come from that became GoogleBooks corpus?

Who (or what) decides what is "American" or "British" in the GoogleBooks corpora?

Is all data "cooked" instead of raw?

Where did the Eighteenth-Century Collections Online (ECCO ) corpus come from? What was the selection criteria? Who selected it?

Is Rickert's method of "scientifically" analyzing text a kind of close reading? An early outline for a Natural Language Processing algorithm?

What kind of hierarchy is implied by Rickert's attempt to apply a "scientific" analysis to literature? (Is "scientific" method being privileged here?

Is there a point where it does not make sense to turn something into data?
