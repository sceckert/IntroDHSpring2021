## Datasets 

For the purposes of this class, we're going to be focusing on datasets that are better suited to humanities projects (data relevant to questions about literature, art, history, and culture). 

General resources for humanities data:

- Melanie Walsh has compiled an excellent [list of links to datasets](https://github.com/melaniewalsh/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/blob/master/book/Datasets/Datasets.ipynb), including a dataset of Nobel Laureates 1901-2017), a dataset of dialogue in 2,000 Hollywood films, a collection of European novels, a collection of Colonial South Asian literature, network data about Game of Thrones Character relationships), an archive of Donald Trump's Tweets, and all the obituaries published in the NYTimes from 1852-2007
- Miriam Posner's [list of datasets](http://miriamposner.com/classes/dh201w21/final-project/datasets/) for her graduate course.
- Alan Liu's  [list of data collections and datasets in *DH Toychest*](http://dhresourcesforprojectbuilding.pbworks.com/w/page/69244469/Data%20Collections%20and%20Datasets) 
	- Liu's list includes [small- and medium-sized collections of texts](http://dhresourcesforprojectbuilding.pbworks.com/w/page/69244469/Data%20Collections%20and%20Datasets#demo-corpora), as well as links to larger collections of documents and images 
- Rutgers University Libraries list of [datasets generated from their collections](https://rutgersdh.github.io/dh-sources/) that relevant for digital humanities research

- [A collection of items from Princeton University Art Museum](https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/) datasets
	- [Data from the Princeton Art Museum](https://github.com/Princeton-University-Art-Museum/puam-api-docs) is available via an API (an application programming interface). For instructions on how to access the interface through specific URL addresses, see [the project overview page](https://github.com/Princeton-University-Art-Museum/puam-api-docs). The data is available in JSON -- short for JavaScript Object Notation––format.
	- Links to CSVs of small sub-collections from the Art Museum coming shortly!
- [A dataset of 50 years of Billboard Hot 100 pop music lyrics](https://github.com/walkerkq/musiclyrics), created by data scientist Kaylin Walker

- [The New York Public Library's Menu dataset](https://web.archive.org/web/20181103032331/http://menus.nypl.org/data)
	- Link to project resources and dataset here: The NYPL project page is no longer live (after completing their project to get the public to help aid in transcribing menus from their collection), but a zip file of archived dataset can still be accessed [here](https://github.com/sceckert/IntroDHSpring2021/tree/main/_datasets/NYPL-Menu-Dataset.zip?raw=true) 
	- To access an overview of the data and project glossary, see [Curating Menus](http://curatingmenus.org/data_dictionary/)
- [Torn Apart/Separados project](http://xpmethod.columbia.edu/torn-apart/volume/1/) data
	- Download a modified set of the project data (courtesy of Melanie Walsh) [here](https://github.com/sceckert/IntroDHSpring2021/blob/main/_datasets/Torn-Apart-Separados-Project.zip?raw=True)
	- Download dataset (as well as additional project data) from the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/xpmethod/torn-apart-open-data)
	- For more on the composition and origins of the data, scroll down to the [section labeled "Data" on the project credits page](http://xpmethod.columbia.edu/torn-apart/credits.html).
- [Switching the Lens - Rediscovering Londoners of African, Caribbean, Asian and Indigenous Heritage, 1561 to 1840](https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/history-and-heritage/london-metropolitan-archives/about-lma/switching-the-lens-project) project [dataset](https://search.lma.gov.uk/scripts/mwimain.dll?logon&application=UNION_VIEW&language=144&file=[lma]through-the-lens.html&utm_source=col&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=switching-the-lens) 
- [The Victorian Women Writers Project](https://github.com/iulibdcs/Victorian-Women-Writers-Project)

Other humanities data resources: 
- [*The Pudding*'s repository of data](https://github.com/the-pudding/data#data-sets) connected to their data journalism stories
	- A heads up: with *The Pudding*, you'll want to be careful to say something new about the data beyond the original story that the dataset was assembled for. 
-  Jeremy Singer (an independent data journalist) also has running dataset newsletter called *Data is Plural*. You can view the [archive of datasets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0) or subscribe [here](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural). 
	- A heads up: unlike the more curated sets of humanities data above, these datasets lists are in varied formats, and come with *varying* levels of contextual detail.
