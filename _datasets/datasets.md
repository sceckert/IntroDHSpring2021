## Datasets 

For the purposes of this class, we're going to be focusing on datasets that are better suited to humanities projects (data relevant to questions about literature, art, history, and culture). 


- [A collection of metadata for 2,000 novels––their publishers, some the parts they include, notes about the material features of specific copies–– published between 1660 and 1850](https://github.com/earlynovels/) created as a part of the [Early Novels Database (END](https://earlynovels.github.io/) 
	- Full [dataset](https://github.com/earlynovels/end-dataset)
	- Small collection of [metadata about 25 novels](https://github.com/earlynovels/digital-collection) and [full-texts for those 25 novels](https://github.com/earlynovels/digital-collection/tree/master/PaP-END-fulltexts)
- [A collection of borrowing records from an English-language lending-library in Paris in the 1920s-1930s](https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/about/data/) - see the [Shakespeare and Company dataset](https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/about/data/) and project documentation
- [The Victorian Women Writers Project](https://github.com/iulibdcs/Victorian-Women-Writers-Project)
	- Link to a collection of full-texts by 19th-century women writers
	- Link to a collection of XML-encoded
- Princeton University Art Museum datasets
	- Links coming shortly!
- [A dataset of 50 years of Billboard Hot 100 pop music lyrics](https://github.com/walkerkq/musiclyrics), created by data scientist Kaylin Walker
- [A collection of metadata about comics in North America](https://github.com/ktopham/comics-as-data) in Michigan State University Library Comics Art Collection
- [The New York Public Library's Menu dataset](https://web.archive.org/web/20181103032331/http://menus.nypl.org/data)
	- Link to project resources and dataset here: The NYPL project page is no longer live (after completing their project to get the public to help aid in transcribing menus from their collection), but a zip file of archived dataset can still be accessed [here](https://github.com/sceckert/IntroDHSpring2021/tree/main/_datasets/NYPL-Menu-Dataset.zip?raw=true) 
	- To access an overview of the data and project glossary, see [Curating Menus](http://curatingmenus.org/data_dictionary/)
- Torn Apart/Separados project data
	- Download a modified set of the project (courtesy of Melanie Walsh) here
	- Download dataset (as well as additional project data) from the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/xpmethod/torn-apart-open-data)
	- For more on the composition and origins of the data, scroll down to the [section labeled "Data" on the project credits page](http://xpmethod.columbia.edu/torn-apart/credits.html).
- Melanie Walsh has compiled a [list of links to list of datasets](https://github.com/melaniewalsh/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/blob/master/book/Datasets/Datasets.ipynb), including a dataset of Nobel Laureates 1901-2017), a dataset of dialogue in 2,000 Hollywood films, a collection of European novels, a collection of Colonial South Asian literature, network data about Game of Thrones Character relationships), an archive of Donald Trump's Tweets, and all the obituaries published in the NYTimes from 1852-2007

Other humanities data resources: 

- [*The Pudding*'s repository of data](https://github.com/the-pudding/data#data-sets) connected to their data journalism stories
	- A heads up: with *The Pudding*, you'll want to be careful to say something new about the data beyond the original story that the dataset was assembled for. 
- Miriam Posner's list of [datasets](http://miriamposner.com/classes/dh201w21/final-project/datasets/) for her graduate course.
- Alan Liu's set of [data collections and datasets in *DH Toychest*](http://dhresourcesforprojectbuilding.pbworks.com/w/page/69244469/Data%20Collections%20and%20Datasets) 
-  Jeremy Singer (an independent data journalist) also has running dataset newsletter called *Data is Plural*. You can view the [archive of datasets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0) or subscribe [here](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural). 
	- A heads up: unlike the more curated sets of humanities data above, these datasets lists are in varied formats, and come with *varying* levels of contextual detail.
